# Monopoly

## Overview

This project is a Monopoly game implemented by Devam Sisodraker and Kayla Oxland in Haskell for the CPSC 312 course at the University of British Columbia. The goal of the project is to showcase our understanding of functional programming concepts, language features, and software design principles through the implementation of a classic board game.

## Features

- Functional Paradigm: The Monopoly game is implemented entirely in Haskell, showcasing our proficiency in functional programming.

- Modular Design: The code is organized into modular components, making it easy to understand, extend, and maintain.

- Game Logic: The project includes comprehensive game logic, such as player movement, property ownership, rent calculation, and turn management.

- User Interface: Although focused on the console for simplicity, the game features a user-friendly interface for players to interact with.

- Testing: Extensive testing has been performed to ensure the correctness and reliability of the implemented features.

## How to Play

- Installation: Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheD3vel0per/Monopoly.git
cd Monopoly
stack run
```

- Follow On-screen Instructions: The game will provide on-screen instructions for players to navigate and play the Monopoly game.


Special thanks to the CPSC 312 course instructors for providing the opportunity to work on this project and apply the principles learned throughout the course.
